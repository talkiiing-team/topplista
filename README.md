## Brief description
This repository contains a leaderboard for KGS Go game server which is created by [roamiiing](github.com/roamiiing) and [talkenson](github.com/talkenson). Its functionality includes:
- Listing top-100 players
- Listing players' most recent games
- Watching their games with rewind

## Project structure
This is a client-server web application. The repository consists of two folders: `client` and `server` both of which are **Node.js** packages.

The whole project is written in **TypeScript** which is is an open-source language that builds on JavaScript and provides strict typization. To enforce code style we are using **ESLint**, because we are working in a ~~small~~ team and the code must be consistent.

### Client
The client is a single page web application. Used technologies and libraries are listed below:
* **React** - framework for creating user interfaces
* **axios** - makes HTTP requests
* **node-sass and SCSS** - CSS pre-processors
* **luxon** - makes date-time processing in javascript a lot better

### Server
The server is a RESTful API which connects to the KGS server with provided login and password. Used technologies:
* **express** - REST API framework
* **axios** - makes HTTP requests
* **cherio** - scrapes html pages (is used to scrape the leaderboard)
* **nodemon** - watches files and refreshes the process on any change

There are also smaller packages such as:
* **cors** and **helmet** - set the right headers for HTTP responses
* **connect-timeout** and **express-queue** - express middlewares to add automatic timeout and queue management
* **dotenv** - provide environmental variables to the API. The usage is described [here](server/README.md).

The API is documented and the documentation is available [here](server/README.md).

### How server works
* The application attempts to send a `LOGIN` request to KGS.
* After it is logged in, it constantly sends `GET` requests and gets data.
* The needed data is *cached* in a custom cache service, which is made to make multiple users able to send requests at the same time as KGS responds randomly.
* When the user sends a request, the endpoint handler makes a request and subscribes to the cache changes. When the content is delivered, the handler returns the requested data to user.

The leaderboard itself returns data from the scrapped web page from the kgsgo.com website.
